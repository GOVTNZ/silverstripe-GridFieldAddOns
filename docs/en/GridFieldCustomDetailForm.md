# Gridfield Custom Detail Form

If you work with `DataObject`s and `GridField`s a lot in SilverStripe, it can be time
consuming hunting down all instances where an object can be edited and swap them out
with a custom edit form.

This simple module allows you to change the GridFieldDetailFormItemRequest class used by
`GridFieldDetailForm` via a simple config variable (set on the record being edited).
This then automatically updates the `GridFieldDetailForm` in all areas the record is
edited in a `GridField`

## Usage

First off you need to create a custom edit form to be loaded into your GridFields.
Something like:

```
namespace App\Forms;

use SilverStripe\Forms\GridField\GridFieldDetailForm_ItemRequest;

class CustomDetailForm_ItemRequest extends GridFieldDetailForm_ItemRequest
{
    /**
     * Customise the default edit form generated by SilverStripe
     *
     * @return Form|HTTPResponse
     */
    public function ItemEditForm()
    {
        $form = parent::ItemEditForm();
        
        //... Customise your edit form
        
        return $form;
    }
}
```

Once you have done this, simply add the `gridfield_request_class` config variable to
your `DataObject` and then this module will swap out the `GridFieldDetailForm_ItemRequest`
class automatically in all `GridField`s:

```
namespace App\Model\Submissions;

use SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject;
use App\Forms\CustomDetailForm_ItemRequest;

class MyDataObject extends DataObject
{
    private static $table_name = "MyDataObject";

    private static $db = [
        'Name' => 'Varchar',
        'Description' => 'HTMLText',
    ];

    private static $gridfield_request_class = CustomDetailForm_ItemRequest::class;
}
```
